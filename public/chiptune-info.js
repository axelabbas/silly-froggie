// This would be a real chiptune audio file
// For demonstration, I'll show you how to add a URL to a real chiptune track
// You can replace this with any .mp3, .ogg, or .wav file

// Example sources for free chiptune music:
// - https://freemusicarchive.org (search for "chiptune" or "8-bit")
// - https://opengameart.org (royalty-free game music)
// - https://incompetech.com (free background music)

// To use an external file:
// 1. Download a chiptune .mp3 file
// 2. Put it in the public folder as "chiptune-bg.mp3"
// 3. The code will automatically use it

// For now, here's a free chiptune URL you can test:
const exampleChiptuneUrl = "https://www.soundjay.com/misc/sounds/beep-07.mp3";

export default exampleChiptuneUrl;
